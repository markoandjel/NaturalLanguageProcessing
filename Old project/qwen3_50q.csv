Okay, let's see. The question is asking what something I came to believe when someone I trust told me about it. The options are A through F. 

First, I need to think about who I trust and what they told me. Let me think of a real-life example. Maybe someone I trust, like a friend or family member, shared a story or information. For example, if my friend told me about something, and I came to believe in it. 

Looking at the options, option C says I came to believe that the Earth is round. That's a common belief, right? Like the geocentric model. But wait, the Earth is actually round, so maybe that's a correct answer. But wait, the question is phrased as ""something you came to believe when someone you trust told you about it."" So if someone told me about it, and I came to believe in it. 

Option D says I came to believe that God is real. That's a big one. I've come to believe in God, so that's a possibility. But maybe the question is looking for a specific answer. 

Option E: I came to believe that there are extraterrestrials on Earth. That's also a possibility, but maybe not as directly related as a personal belief. 

Option F: I came to believe that the Earth is flat. That's the opposite of what I know. So that's probably wrong. 

Option A: I came to believe that vaccines are dangerous. That's a common misconception, but maybe not something someone I trust would tell me. 

So between C and D. If someone I trust told me about the Earth being round, and I came to believe in it, then C would be correct. But if someone told me about the Earth being flat, and I came to believe in that, then F would be correct. 

But wait, the question is phrased as ""something you came to believe when someone you trust told you about it."" So the answer is the specific belief that someone I trust told me. So if the person I trust told me about the Earth being round, and I came to believe in it, then C is correct. If the person told me about the Earth being flat, then F. 

But which one is more likely? I think the Earth being round is a common belief, so maybe C. But wait, the question is phrased",,,False,,False
